              * Developed the algorithm to interpret the new position of the lane dividers after the camera has changed a little bit. `Avanti R&D`

              * Developed the algorithm to automatically control the PTZ camera to the predefined position (given the reference image). `Avanti R&D`

              * Developed the algorithm to automatically detect the lane dividers based on the vehicle trajectories on the roads. `Avanti R&D`

              * Developed, tested, improved algorithms to the `FaceLog` system: Optimize streaming process. Fix bug for the recognition flow. Implement head pose estimation. Implement Face quality analysis. Add the antispoffing model. Allows `FaceLog` to use for automatic checkin checkout.
